# toDoList
This project is a simple React-based Todo App that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks or to-dos. The app provides the following functionality:

1.Task Creation: Users can input a new task in an input field and click the "Add" button to add it to their list of to-dos.

2.Task List Display: The app displays a list of tasks as an unordered list (<ul>). Each task is represented as a list item (<li>) and is accompanied by options to mark it as complete, undo a completed task, and delete the task.

3.Task State: Each task in the list has a text description and a completed status. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a CSS class, making it easy to identify completed and pending tasks.

4.Mark as Complete/Undo: Users can click the "Complete" button to mark a task as complete, and it will change the appearance to indicate completion. Clicking the "Undo" button reverses the completion status.

4.Task Deletion: Users can click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
